## Latest Version
**Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/arachy/appOpener/releases)!**\
\
*Important:*\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once downloaded, extract the folder called 'App Opener' from the .zip folder. Make sure you leave the app in this folder\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it creates other files that are needed to load saved apps.
## To Do List
A list of ideas I want to implement to the app, I will add and remove things from this list over time.
