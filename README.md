A simple app that opens other apps :P\
Written in Python.\
Useful for quickly opening multiple apps at once.
## Latest Version
**Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/arachy/appOpener/releases)!**\
\
*Important:*\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once downloaded, extract the folder called 'App Opener' from the .zip folder. Make sure you leave the app in this folder &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it creates other files that are needed to load saved apps.
## To Do List
A list of ideas I want to implement to the app, I will add and remove things from this list over time.\
* Add a Profiles option, which lets you save and load multiple different presets
